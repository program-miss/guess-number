## ðŸ“‹ Objective

Welcome to the Guess the Number game! This is a thrilling game based on random number generation, where each round offers a new challenge. The objective is simple: observe the rising Multiplier value, predict when it will freeze, and place your points based on that prediction.

### How to Win

- At the start of each round, every player receives an equal amount of starting points.
- Your task is to guess when the Multiplier will freeze.
- If you guess correctly, you'll win the round and earn points calculated by multiplying the points you placed by the Multiplier (Points x Multiplier).
- If you guess wrong, you lose the points you placed.
